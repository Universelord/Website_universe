        Yo guys i am Srinish aka Universe_lord. I am 14 yrs old weird kid.</p>
     <p>
         i like tech and i like to test them out like i will try to learn about how it works and "hack" it (in my terms hack or hacking means that i will modifi it to do what it is not supposed to do). 
     </p>
     <p>
         also i would like to start a yt channel but i suck at doing things and cannot do anything alone so i would like a co host.
     </p>
     <p>
        I could ask my friends and i have made some school asignmentswith friends so that i know how i work with a friend but i cant ask them because we are in 10th class so they will be bussy with school and will only study mostly and wont try these.
     </p>
     <p>
        so here is my email universe_lordmc@gmail.com to contact me about being a co host
